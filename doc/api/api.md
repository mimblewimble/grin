# Grin API Documentation

This document contains the documentation for the 3 Grin REST APIs. These endpoints can be grouped in two categories.

## Ports above 10000?

All ports should be below 10000 when running with default settings on mainnet. If your grin owner_api is using the 13420 port but is on mainnet, then you're using an outdated version of grin.
