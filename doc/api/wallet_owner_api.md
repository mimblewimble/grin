### POST Finalize Tx

Sender finalization of the transaction. Takes the slate returned by the sender as well as the private file generate on the first send step.
Builds the complete transaction but will **not** sends it to a grin node for propagation. Use [POST Post Tx](#post-post-tx) for that.

  `POST`

### Add Foreign API Endpoints

For some environments it may be convenient to have the [wallet foreign API](wallet_foreign_api.md) available on the same port as the owner API.  You can do so by setting the `owner_api_include_foreign` configuration setting to `true`.
