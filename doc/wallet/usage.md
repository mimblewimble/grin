# Grin - Basic Wallet

## Wallet Files

A Grin wallet maintains its state in an LMDB database, with the master seed stored in a separate file.
When creating a new wallet, the file structure should be:

```sh
~/[Wallet Directory]
   -wallet_data/
      -db/
         -/lmdb
      wallet.seed
   grin-wallet.toml
   grin-wallet.log
```

* `grin-wallet.toml` contains configuration information for the wallet. You can modify values within
  to change ports, the address of your grin node, or logging values.

* `wallet_data/wallet.seed` is your master seed file. Its contents are encrypted with your password (required).
  You should back this file up somewhere in order to be able to recover or restore your wallet. Your seed file
  can also be recovered using a seed phrase if you lose this file or forget your password.

### Data Directory

By default grin will create all wallet files in the hidden directory `.grin` under your home directory (i.e. `~/.grin`).
You can also create and use a wallet with data files in the current directory, as explained in the `grin wallet init`
command below.

#### Logging + Output

Logging configuration for the wallet is read from `grin-wallet.toml`.

#### Switches common to all wallet commands

### Wallet Account

The wallet supports multiple accounts. To set the active account for a wallet command, use the '-a' switch, e.g:

```
[host]$ grin wallet -a account_1 info
```

All output creation, transaction building, and querying is done against a particular account in the wallet.
If the '-a' switch is not provided for a command, the account named 'default' is used.

##### Grin Node Address

The wallet generally needs to talk to a running grin node in order to remain up-to-date and verify its contents. By default, the wallet
tries to contact a node at `127.0.0.1:13413`. To change this, modify the value in the wallet's `grin_wallet.toml` file. Alternatively,
you can provide the `-r` (seRver) switch to the wallet command, e.g.:

```sh
[host]$ grin wallet -a "http://192.168.0.2:1341" info
```

If commands that need to update from a grin node can't find one, they will generally inform you that the node couldn't be reached
and the results verified against the latest chain information.

##### Password

Your wallet.seed file, which contains your wallet's unique master seed, is encrypted with your password. Your password is specified
at wallet creation time, and must be provided for any wallet operation. You will be prompted for your password when required, but
you can also specify it on the command line by providing the `-p`argument.

```sh
[host]$ grin wallet -p mypass info
```

## Basic Wallet Commands

`grin wallet --help` will display usage info and all flags.
`grin wallet help [command]` will display flags specific to the command, e.g `grin wallet help listen`

### init

Before using a wallet a new `grin-wallet.toml` configuration file, master seed contained in `wallet.seed` and storage database need
to be generated via the init command as follows:

```sh
[host]$ grin wallet init
```

You will be prompted to enter a password for the new wallet. By default, your wallet files will be placed into `~/.grin`. Alternatively, 
if you'd like to run a wallet in a directory other than the default, you can run:

```sh
[host]$ grin wallet -p mypass init -h
```

This will create a `grin-wallet.toml` file in the current directory configured to use the data files in the current directory,
as well as all needed data files. When running any `grin wallet` command, grin will check the current directory to see if
a `grin-wallet.toml` file exists. If not it will use the default in `~/.grin`

The init command will also print a 24 (or 12) word recovery phrase, which you should write down and store in a non-digital format. This
phrase can be used to re-create your master seed file if it gets lost or corrupted, or you forget the wallet password. If you'd prefer
to use a 12-word recovery phrase, you can also pass in the `--short_wordlist` or `-s` parameter.

It is also highly recommended that you back up the `~/.grin/wallet_data/wallet.seed` file somewhere safe and private,
and ensure you somehow remember the password used to encrypt the wallet seed file.

### recover

The `recover` command is used to regenerate your wallet seed file from your recovery phrase. Note that this operation only
restores your seed file, not the outputs stored in your wallet. If, for instance, you forget your wallet password, you can
delete the `wallet_data/wallet.seed` file from your wallet data directory, run `grin wallet recover`, and (provided you used
the correct recovery phrase,) your wallet contents should again be usable.

To recover your wallet seed, delete (or backup) the wallet's `wallet_data/wallet.seed` file, then run:

```sh
[host]$ grin wallet recover -p "[12 or 24 word passphrase separated by spaces"

e.g:

[host]$ grin wallet recover -p "shiver alarm excuse turtle absorb surface lunch virtual want remind hard slow vacuum park silver asthma engage library battle jelly buffalo female inquiry wire"
```

If you're restoring a wallet from scratch, you'll then need to use the `grin wallet restore` command to scan the chain
for your outputs and restore them. See the `grin wallet restore` command below for details of the entire process.

You can also view your recovery phrase with your password by running the recover command without any arguments, e.g:


```sh
[host]$ grin wallet recover
Password:
Your recovery phrase is:
shiver alarm excuse turtle absorb surface lunch virtual want remind hard slow vacuum park silver asthma engage library battle jelly buffalo female inquiry wire
Please back-up these words in a non-digital format.
```

### account

To create a new account, use the 'grin wallet account' command with the argument '-c', e.g.:

```
[host]$ grin wallet account -c my_account
```

This will create a new account called 'my_account'. To use this account in subsequent commands, provide the '-a' flag to
all wallet commands:

```
[host]$ grin wallet -a my_account info
```

To display a list of created accounts in the wallet, use the 'account' command with no flags:

```
[host]$ grin wallet account
```
This will print out the following.
```sh
____ Wallet Accounts ____

 Name       | Parent BIP-32 Derivation Path
------------+-------------------------------
 default    | m/0/0
 my_account | m/1/0
 
```

### info

A summary of the wallet's contents can be retrieved from the wallet using the `info` command. Note that the `Total` sum may appear
inflated if you have a lot of unconfirmed outputs in your wallet (especially ones where a transaction is initiated by other parties
who then never it by posting to the chain). `Currently Spendable` is the most accurate field to look at here.

```sh
____ Wallet Summary Info - Account 'default' as of 49 ____

 Total                            | 3000.000000000
 Awaiting Confirmation            | 60.000000000
 Immature Coinbase                | 180.000000000
 Currently Spendable              | 2760.000000000
 ---------                        | ---------
 (Locked by previous transaction) | 0.000000000

```

### listen

This opens a listener on the specified port, which will listen for:

* Coinbase Transaction from a mining server
* Transactions initiated by other parties

By default the `listen` commands runs in a manner that only allows access from the local machine. To open this port up
to other machines, use the `-e` switch:

```sh
[host]$ grin wallet -e listen
```

To change the port on which the wallet is listening, either configure `grin-wallet.toml` or use the `-l` flag, e.g:

```sh
[host]$ grin wallet -l 14000 listen
```

The wallet will listen for requests until the process is cancelled with `<Ctrl-C>`. Note that external ports/firewalls need to be configured
properly if you're expecting requests from outside your local network (well out of the scope of this document).

### send

This builds a transaction interactively with another running wallet, then posts the final transaction to the chain. As the name suggests,
this is how you send Grins to another party.

The most important fields here are the destination (`-d`)  and the amount itself. To send an amount to another listening wallet:

```sh
[host]$ grin wallet send -d "http://192.168.0.10:13415" 60.00
```

This will create a transaction with the other wallet listening at 192.168.0.10, port 13415 which credits the other wallet 60 grins
while debiting the 60 Grin + fees from your wallet.

It's important to understand exactly what happens during a send command, so at a very basic level the `send` interaction goes as follows:

1) Your wallet selects a number of unspent inputs from your wallet, enough to cover the 60 grins + fees.
2) Your wallet locks these inputs so as not to select them for other transactions, and creates a change output in your wallet for the difference.
3) Your wallet adds these inputs and outputs to a transaction, and sends the transaction to the recipient.
4) The recipient adds their output for 60 grins to the transaction, and returns it to the sender.
5) The sender completes signing of the transaction.
6) The sender posts the transaction to the chain.

Outputs in your wallet will appear as unconfirmed or locked until the transaction hits the chain and is mined and validated.

You can also create a transaction entirely within your own wallet by specifying the method 'self'. Using the 'self' method, you can send yourself money in a single command (for testing purposes,) or distribute funds between accounts within your wallet without having to run a listener or manipulate files. For instance, to send funds from your wallet's 'default' account to an account called 'account1', use:

```sh
[host]$ grin wallet send -m self -d "account1" 60
```

or, to send between accounts, use the -a flag to specify the source account:

```sh
[host]$ grin wallet -a "my_source_account" send -m self -d "my_dest_account" 60
```

When sending to self, the transaction will be created and posted to the chain in the same operation.

Other flags here are:

* `-m` 'Method', which can be 'http', 'file' or 'self' (described above). If 'http' is specified (default), the transaction will be sent to the IP address which follows the `-d` flag. If 'file' is specified, Grin wallet will generate a partial transaction file under the file name specified in the `-d` flag. This file needs to be signed by the recipient using the `grin wallet receive -i filename` command and finalized by the sender using the `grin wallet finalize -i filename.response` command. To create a partial transaction file, use:

 ```sh
[host]$ grin wallet send -d "transaction" -m file 60.00
```

* `-s` 'Selection strategy', which can be 'all' or 'smallest'. Since it's advantageous for outputs to be removed from the Grin chain,
  the default strategy for selecting inputs in Step 1 above is to use as many outputs as possible to consolidate your balance into a
  couple of outputs. This also drastically reduces your wallet size, so everyone wins. The downside is that the entire contents of
  your wallet remains locked until the transaction is  mined validated on the chain. To instead only select just enough inputs to
  cover the amount you want to send + fees, use:

 ```sh
[host]$ grin wallet send -d "http://192.168.0.10:13415" -s smallest 60.00
```

* `-f` 'Fluff' Grin uses a protocol called 'Dandelion' which bounces your transaction directly through several listening nodes in a
  'Stem Phase' before randomly 'Fluffing', i.e. broadcasting it to the entire network. This reduces traceability at the cost of lengthening
  the time before your transaction appears on the chain. To ignore the stem phase and broadcast immediately:

 ```sh
[host]$ grin wallet send -f -d "http://192.168.0.10:13415" 60.00
```

* `-g` 'Message' - You can specify an optional message to include alongside your transaction data. This message is purely for informational
purposes between all transacting participants, and is not included in transaction data sent to the chain. Each participant message includes
a signature that can be verified with the participant's public key. A message can also be specified by the recipient during a `grin wallet receive`
command.

```sh
[host]$ grin wallet send -f -d "http://192.168.0.10:13415" -g "This is from Dave" 60.00
```

### outputs

Simply displays all the the outputs in your wallet: e.g:

```sh
[host]$ grin wallet outputs
Wallet Outputs - Account 'default' - Block Height: 49

```

Spent outputs are not shown by default. To show them, provide the `-s` flag.

 ```sh
[host]$ grin wallet -s outputs
```

### txs

Every time an operation is performed in your wallet (receive coinbase, send, receive), an entry is added to an internal transaction log
containing vital information about the transaction. Because the Mimblewimble chain contains no identifying information whatsoever,
this transaction log is necessary in order to allow your wallet to keep track of what was sent and received. To view the contents of the
transaction log, use the `txs`

```sh
[host]$ grin wallet txs
Transaction Log - Account 'default' - Block Height: 49

```

#### cancel

Everything before Step 6 in the send phase above happens completely locally in the wallets' data storage and separately from the chain.
Since it's very easy for a sender, (through error or malice,) to fail to post a transaction to the chain, it's very possible for the contents
of a wallet to become locked, with all outputs unable to be selected because the wallet is waiting for a transaction that will never hit
the chain to complete. For example, in the output from `grin wallet txs -i 6` above, the transaction is showing as `confirmed == false`
meaning the wallet has not seen any of the associated outputs on the chain. If it's evident that this transaction will never be posted, locked
outputs can be unlocked and associate unconfirmed outputs removed with the `cancel` command.

Running against the data above:

```sh
[host]$ grin wallet cancel -i 6
[host]$ grin wallet txs -i 6
Transaction Log - Account 'default' - Block Height: 49
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Id  Type                     Shared Transaction Id                 Creation Time                      Confirmed?  Confirmation Time  Num. Inputs  Num. Outputs  Amount Credited  Amount Debited  Fee   Net Difference
=======================================================================================================================================================================================================================
 6   Received Tx - Cancelled  03715cf6-f29b-4a3a-bda5-b02cba6bf0d9  2018-07-20 19:46:46.120244904 UTC  false       None               0            1             60.000000000     0.000000000     None  60.000000000
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

```

Note that the Receive transaction has been cancelled, and the corresponding output was removed from the wallet. If I were the sender, my change
output would have been deleted, and any outputs that were locked for the transaction would again be available for use in another transaction.

Be sure to use this command with caution, as there are many edge cases and possible attacks that still need to be dealt with, particularly if you're
the recipient of a transaction. For the time being please be 100% certain that the relevant transaction is never, ever going to be posted before
running `grin wallet cancel`

##### repost

If you're the sender of a posted transaction that doesn't confirm on the chain (due to a fork or full transaction pool), you can repost the copy of it that grin automatically stores in your wallet data whenever a transaction is finalized. This doesn't need to communicate with the recipient again, it just re-posts a transaction created during a previous `send` attempt.  

To do this, look up the transaction id using the `grin wallet txs` command, and using the id (say 3 in this example,) enter:

`grin wallet repost -i 3`

This will attempt to repost the transaction to the chain. Note this won't attempt to send if the transaction is already marked as 'confirmed' within the wallet.

You can also use the `repost` command to dump the transaction in a raw json format with the `-m` (duMp) switch, e.g:

`grin wallet repost -i 3 -m tx_3.json`

This will create a file called tx_3.json containing your raw transaction data. Note that this formatting in the file isn't yet very user-readable.

##### restore

If for some reason the wallet cancel commands above don't work, you need to restore from a backed up `wallet.seed` file and password, or have recovered the wallet seed from a recovery phrase, you can perform a full wallet restore.

To do this, generate an empty wallet somewhere with:

```sh
grin wallet init -h
```

Delete the newly generated wallet data directory and seed file:

```sh
[host@new_wallet_dir]# rm -rf wallet_data/db
[host@new_wallet_dir]# rm wallet_data/wallet.seed
```

If you need to recover your wallet seed from a recovery phrase, use the `grin wallet recover -p "[recovery phrase]" command
as outlined above. Otherwise, if you're restoring from a backed-up seed file, simply copy your backed up `wallet.seed` file 
into the new `wallet_data` directory, ensuring it's called `wallet.seed`

Ensure the Grin node with which your wallet is talking is running, and make sure nothing is attempting to mine into your wallet.
Then, in the wallet directory:

```sh
grin wallet restore

Note this operation can potentially take a long time. Once it's done, your wallet outputs should be restored, and you can
transact with your restored wallet as before the backup. Your transaction log history is not restored, and will simply
contain incoming transactions for each output found.

## Wallet plugins

Other than the default communication methods (http, file), grin exposes an interface that developers can use to integrate
any communication channel (i.e Telegram, Signal, email) for the exchange of slates.

### Keybase

Grin comes bundled with an experimental keybase.io plugin. The keybase client must be installed in the system. Usage is as follows:

Recipient starts a keybase listener.
```sh
grin wallet listen -m keybase
```

Sender creates a transaction, sends it to the recipient and awaits for the reply.

```sh
grin wallet send <amount> -m keybase -d <recipient>
```

Where recipient is a keybase username. If everything goes well the transaction is finalized and sent to the node for broadcasting.
