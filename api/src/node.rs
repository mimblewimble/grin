/// Main interface into all node API functions.
/// Node API functionality are in the ['Node'](struct.Node.html)
///
/// * The 'Owner' API is intended to expose methods that are to be
/// used by the wallet owner only. It is vital that this API is not
/// exposed to anyone other than the owner of the wallet (i.e. the
/// person with access to the seed and password.
///
/// Methods in this API are intended to be 'single use'.

	/// Returns summary information from the active account in the wallet.
	///
	/// # Arguments
	/// * `keychain_mask` - Wallet secret mask to XOR against the stored wallet seed before using, if
	/// being used.
	/// * `refresh_from_node` - If true, the wallet will attempt to contact
	/// a node (via the [`NodeClient`](../grin_wallet_libwallet/types/trait.NodeClient.html)
	/// provided during wallet instantiation). If `false`, the results will
	/// contain transaction information that may be out-of-date (from the last time
	/// the wallet's output set was refreshed against the node).
	/// * `minimum_confirmations` - The minimum number of confirmations an output
	/// should have before it's included in the 'amount_currently_spendable' total
	///
	/// # Returns
	/// * (`bool`, [`WalletInfo`](../grin_wallet_libwallet/types/struct.WalletInfo.html)) - A tuple:
	/// * The first `bool` element indicates whether the data was successfully
	/// refreshed from the node (note this may be false even if the `refresh_from_node`
	/// argument was set to `true`.
	/// * The second element contains the Summary [`WalletInfo`](../grin_wallet_libwallet/types/struct.WalletInfo.html)
	///
	/// # Example
	/// Set up as in [`new`](struct.Owner.html#method.new) method above.
	/// ```
	/// # grin_wallet_api::doctest_helper_setup_doc_env!(wallet, wallet_config);
	///
	/// let mut api_owner = Owner::new(wallet.clone());
	/// let update_from_node = true;
	/// let minimum_confirmations=10;
	///
	/// // Return summary info for active account
	/// let result = api_owner.retrieve_summary_info(None, update_from_node, minimum_confirmations);
	///
