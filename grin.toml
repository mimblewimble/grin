# Sample Server Configuration File for Grin
#
# When running the grin executable without specifying any command line
# arguments, it will look for this file in three places, in the following
# order:
#
# -The working directory
# -The directory in which the executable resides
# -[user home]/.grin

#the address on which services will listen, e.g. Transaction Pool
