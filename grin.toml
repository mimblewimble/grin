# Sample Server Configuration File for Grin
#
# When running the grin executable without specifying any command line
# arguments, it will look for this file in three places, in the following
# order:
#
# -The working directory
# -The directory in which the executable resides
# -[user home]/.grin
#

#Server connection details
[server]

#the address on which services will listen, e.g. Transaction Pool

#is stored

#AutomatedTesting - For CI builds and instant blockchain creation
#UserTesting - For regular user testing, much lighter than production more

#to run cards in parallel

### CUCKOO MINER PLUGIN CONFIGURATION ###
#########################################

# These entries configure instances of cuckoo miner
# plugins if the 'use_cuckoo_miner' value above is
# set to 'true'.
#
# Multiple plugins can be specified, (e.g. a cpu
# miner and a gpu miner running in parallel). However,
# if 'use_async_mode' above is set to 'false', only
# the first plugin specified will be used for mining
# in single-threaded mode

# You'll likely get the best performance using a
# single GPU and single CPU plugin in parallel

#The fastest cpu algorithm, but consumes the most memory
