# Sample Server Configuration File for Grin
#
# When running the grin executable without specifying any command line
# arguments, it will look for this file in three places, in the following
# order:
#
# -The working directory
# -The directory in which the executable resides
# -[user home]/.grin
#

#Server connection details
[server]

#the address on which services will listen, e.g. Transaction Pool
api_http_addr = "127.0.0.1:13413"

#the directory, relative to current, in which the grin blockchain
#is stored
db_root = ".grin"

#How to seed this server, can be None, List or WebStatic
seeding_type = "None"

#if seeding_type = List, the list of peers to connect to.
#seeds = ["192.168.0.1:8080","192.168.0.2:8080"]

#Whether to run in test mode, which at the moment affects cuckoo_size
#if this is false tries to use a slow cuckoo30 at the moment, not 
#recommended
test_mode = true

#7 = Bit flags for FULL_NODE, this structure needs to be changed
#internally to make it more configurable
capabilities = [7]
        
#The P2P server details (i.e. the server that communicates with other
#grin server nodes
[server.p2p_config]
host = "127.0.0.1"
port = 13414
        
#Mining details. This section is optional. If it's not here, the server 
#will default to not mining. 

[mining]
#flag whether mining is enabled
enable_mining = true

#the wallet reciever to which coinbase rewards will be sent

#whether to ignore the reward (mostly for testing)
