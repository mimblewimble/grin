# Sample Server Configuration File for Grin
#
# When running the grin executable without specifying any command line
# arguments, it will look for this file in three places, in the following
# order:
#
# -The working directory
# -The directory in which the executable resides
# -[user home]/.grin

#AutomatedTesting - For CI builds and instant blockchain creation

#Testnet2 - Testnet2 genesis block (cuckoo 30)

### CUCKOO MINER PLUGIN CONFIGURATION ###
#########################################

# These entries configure instances of cuckoo miner
# plugins if the 'use_cuckoo_miner' value above is
# set to 'true'.
#
# Multiple plugins can be specified, (e.g. a cpu
# miner and a gpu miner running in parallel). However,
# if 'use_async_mode' above is set to 'false', only
# the first plugin specified will be used for mining
# in single-threaded mode

# You'll likely get the best performance using a
# single GPU plugin and single CPU plugin in parallel

# Parameters can be set per-device. On CPU plugins
# you'll likely only be using device 0 (for now),
# but in CUDA plugins the device number corresponds
# to the device ID. (use nvidia-smi to find this)

#The fastest cpu algorithm, but consumes the most memory
#Also requires instructions that aren't available on
#older processors. In this case, use mean_compat_cpu
#instead
#[[mining.miner_plugin_config]]
#type_filter = "mean_cpu"

#CUDA Miner (Included here for integration only, Not ready for use)
#Can currently be used only in Production (30) Mode
#This plugin is not built by default. To build:
#1) Ensure the latest cuda toolkit is installed
#   (nvcc should be in your PATH)
#2) Uncomment the 'build-cuda-plugin' feature
#   in pow/Cargo.toml
#
#Parameters can be set per device, as below. In sync mode
#device 0 is currently the only device used. In async mode
#device 0 is used by default, and all other devices are
#disabled unless explicitly enabled by setting the 'USE_DEVICE'
#param to 1 on each device, as demonstrated below.
