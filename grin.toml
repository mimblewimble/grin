# Sample Server Configuration File for Grin
#
# When running the grin executable without specifying any command line
# arguments, it will look for this file in three places, in the following
# order:
#
# -The working directory
# -The directory in which the executable resides
# -[user home]/.grin

#parameters used for mining. Can be:
#AutomatedTesting - For CI builds and instant blockchain creation

#Testnet1 - Testnet1 genesis block (cuckoo 16)
#Testnet2 - Testnet2 genesis block (cuckoo 30)
