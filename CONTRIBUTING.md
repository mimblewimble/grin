# Contributing

Find an area you can help with and do it. Open source is about collaboration and open participation. Try to make your code look like what already exists and submit a pull request. If you're looking for additional ideas, the code includes `TODO` comments for minor to major improvements. Grep is your friend.

Additional tests are rewarded with an immense amount of positive karma. So is documentation.

## Style Guide

For info on the Grin style guide, see the [style docs](doc/style.md).

Grin leverages `rustfmt` to maintain consistent formatting (and a [git commit hook](doc/style.md) to run it).
