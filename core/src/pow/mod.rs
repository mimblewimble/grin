//! The proof of work needs to strike a balance between fast header
//! verification to avoid DoS attacks and difficulty for block verifiers to
//! build new blocks. In addition, mining new blocks should also be as
//! difficult on high end custom-made hardware (ASICs) as on commodity hardware
//! or smartphones. For this reason we use Cuckoo Cycle (see the cuckoo
//! module for more information).
//!
//! Note that this miner implementation is here mostly for tests and
//! reference. It's not optimized for speed.
